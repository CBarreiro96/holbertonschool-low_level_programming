### [Linear search](https://github.com/CBarreiro96/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/0-linear.c) 
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

* Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

```C
user@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 0-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        10, 1, 42, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, -1, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, linear_search(array, size, 3));

* Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* You can assume that value won’t appear more than once in array
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray) (See example)

```C
user@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 1-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point

* Prototype : int jump_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located

* Prototype : int interpolation_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order

* To determine the probe position, you can use : size_t pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (value - array[low]))
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
```C
user@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 102-main.c

#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Exponential search algorithm

* Prototype : int exponential_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* You have to use powers of 2 as exponential ranges to search in your array
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching for, you have to print this value (See example)

Once you’ve found the good range, you need to use a binary search:
Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) you’re searching in (See example)
```C
user@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 103-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
