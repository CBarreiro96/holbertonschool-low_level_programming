**Description**
* **"Preprocessor"=** In this exercise I use GCC -E $CFILE >> C becasue GCC(The GNU Compiler Collection) with **-E** It start with first part of compilation(Preprocessor) and It run the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
* **Compiler=** The second part after preprocesor is Comá¹•iler, In this case I use of Comand **GCC** but instead of -E I use **-c** because It is the comand for compiled and Ot compiles a Cfiles but not link.
* **Assembler=** The execise ask me about some comand about generate the assembly code of a C code and saVe it in an output file, I did it with **GCC -S** $file It is the third part of the step about compilation in C.
* **Name** In this case is about compiles C you use **ggc** and about redirecrtion you use or -o or >>. 
* **Puts** In this exercise ask me about in a program in c printf "Programming ..." a text then I use the function main(Void) and command puts.
* **Size.c** It is a file in programing c In this exercise ask me about printf of size, then I use all structure of C and add sizeof() comand with its format(int, long int,char etc)
