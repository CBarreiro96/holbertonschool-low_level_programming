### Write to function that:
0. Prints all the elements of a list_t list.
1. Returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2. Adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
3. Adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
4. Frees a list_t list.
5. Prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.
6. Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
